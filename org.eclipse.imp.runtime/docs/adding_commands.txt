Adding a new keystroke/command to the UniversalEditor:
 1) create the action in createActions()
 2) Add any necessary string resources to the resource bundle
 3) Define a new command (ext pt org.eclipse.ui.commands) and a key binding
    (ext pt org.eclipse.ui.bindings) in plugin.xml
 4) Add appropriate code to TextEditorActionContributor to create an action instance
    and add it to the editor menus, toolbars, and so on, as appropriate. You can make
    the action an instance of RetargetTextEditorAction, in which case you need to
    create a new action operation code in the StructuredSourceViewer, and implement
    support for the new operation in StructuredSourceViewer (see step #5).
    Alternatively, you can create a custom action class, which might subclass
    TextEditorAction (as does GotoAnnotationAction), in which case the implementation
    of the action is in the TextEditorAction subclass' run() method.
 5) If you created a RetargetTextEditorAction:
    - Add handling code to StructuredSourceViewer.doOperation()
    If you created a custom action class:
    - Implement the action's run() method.
